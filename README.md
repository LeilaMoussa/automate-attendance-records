# automate-attendance-records
Automatically update attendance records on Google Sheets

Todos:
- SUM function for new members. (or simply write to existing empty row)
- Implement ten most active members, two most popular events, two least popular events.
- Error handling 1: name does not exist (should i even be using name, rather than IDs)...
- consider IDs: this depends on the input method that is most likely
- Data sanitization and formatting
- Finalize what type of input I should get and from where and how to input it.
- Extend to tutoring participation (another sheet).
